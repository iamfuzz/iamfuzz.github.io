Do not choose a different region. You will also need to create a key pair in this region before proceeding.\nCreate Stack Wizard - Step 1 In the Create Stack wizard, select the Upload a template file radio button, and then provide the CloudFormation template you recently downloaded by clicking on Choose File:\nOnce you have selected the lab1_NewRelic-WP-Infra-APM.template CloudFormation template from the file dialog, you should be returned to the Create Stack Wizard. Click the orange Next button on the bottom right hand side of your screen.\nCreate Stack Wizard - Step 2 You will now need to name your stack; we recommend using New-Relic-Wordpress as that is the name that will be used in the example screenshots below:\nNext, you will choose a key pair from the first dropdown menu in the Parameters section of the wizard:\nNow, you will need to provide your New Relic license key:\nLastly, provide the username and password parameters needed by Wordpress and click the orange Next button on the bottom right hand side of your screen:\nCreate Stack Wizard - Step 3 Nothing needs to be configured in step 3 of the Create Stack Wizard; simply scroll down and click the orange Next button on the bottom right side of your screen.\nCreate Stack Wizard - Step 4 Review the parameters you have provided to see if you have made any obvious errors.

	"content": " What is a Workload? New Relic\u0026rsquo;s Workloads feature gives you the ability to group and monitor entities based on a team or a set of responsibilities, from front-end to back-end services, across your entire stack.\nWorkloads help you understand complex systems, detect issues, understand the cause and impact of an incident, and resolve those issues quickly.\nWhen migrating applications to the cloud, New Relic recommends that you group all of your software stacks into Workloads.\nIn this Workshop, we will be creating a single Workload from our application and underlying host instance and migrating it from one AWS region to another.\nCreating a Workload Open the New Relic One Workloads application and click on the Create a workload button located at the top right hand corner of your screen.\nGive your Workload a name (we recommend New-Relic-Wordpress) and click the Create a workload button on the bottom right hand side of your screen:\nClick on the Add entities link located near the top right hand portion of your screen:\nIn the search bar, type in php and press Enter on your keyboard. Click on the + icons next to the two entries for PHP Application: Service and Browser application.

This time, type Host into the search bar, wait for the Hosts ENTITY TYPE recommendation in the dropdown, and then select it:\nIf you created a new AWS account for this workshop, you should only see one host listed. Click the + icon, followed by clicking the Save changes button to add it to your Workload:\nIf you are using an AWS account with other running instances, you can locate the instance for this Workshop by visting the Stacks page and clicking on the link of the stack name you created for this Workshop (New-Relic-Wordpress):\nYou can then click on the Resources tab and click on the link provided under the Physical ID column for the WebServer that was launched by the template:\nBy default, your instance hostname will be determined by its private IP:\nOnce you have successfully added the host to your Workload, you should be presented with an overview page that looks similar to the one below:\nCongratulations!

Normally, you\u0026rsquo;d use Nimbus to create Workloads from your on-prem estate and migrate them to a cloud provider such as AWS. In this Workshop however, we will simply be migrating the Workload we have created from one AWS region to another.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by opening Nimbus and clicking on the Migrate Workloads link in Getting Started menu near the top left hand side of your screen:\nYou should see the New-Relic-Wordpress Workload listed that we created in the previous step in this Workshop. Click the green Migrate button:\nIn the popup dialog you are presented with, select your New Relic acocunt name from the first dropdown box while ensuring the other dropdowns match what you see in the screenshot below, then click the green Create Project button:\nWhen you clicked on the Create Project button in the previous step, Nimbus automatically created an empty, target Workload that it will use to track your migration progress. Open this Workload by clicking on the link provided in the Target column of your Workload listing:\nMake sure to keep the target Workload browser tab open as we will be revisiting it later in this Workshop.\nCongratulations! You have successfully prepared your Workload for migration and may now move on to the next step in this Workshop.\n"

Instrumentation is the first step in the ongoing effort to continually optimize your cloud environment.\nCloud Optimize New Relic offers a free, open source application named Cloud Optimize that compares the size of your instances to their utilization, identifying resources that are sized larger than needed. Cloud Optimize will estimate your savings by optimizing resource size.\nUnlike other applications that charge a per host fee for this level of information, Cloud Optimize is free of charge for all New Relic customers.\n"
